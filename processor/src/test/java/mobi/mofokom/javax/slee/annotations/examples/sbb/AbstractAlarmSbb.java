/**
 * Simple example for an annotated Sbb, on service start fires a 1 sec timer and
 * on timer event calculates real delay. Examples CMP Field and facilities
 * injection too.
 *
 * A service is defined by applying the {@link Service} annotation too.
 *
 * Regarding field injection: - "default" tracer and SbbContextExt injected
 * before setSbbContext() - by applying CMPField annotation to field, value is
 * injected before sbbLoad(), and persisted after sbbStore(), in case applied to
 * method it identifies one of the CMP Field accessors.
 *
 * A few more notes about event handler method annotations: - initialEventSelect
 * is { InitialEventSelect.ActivityContext } by default - initialEvent is false
 * by default
